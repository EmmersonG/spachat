SPAChat (Simple PHP Angular Ajax Chat)
=======

This project is a refactor of [Joni2Back MySQL Ajax Chat](http://sourceforge.net/projects/joni2back-chat/),
now as "SPAChat - Simple PHP Angular Ajax Chat".

This mini chat was developed with a simple backend MVC architecture and every piece of code in the same file.

#### Uses:
* AngularJS
* jQuery
* PHP >= 5.3
* mySQL

#### Some of the features that I think could be useful:

* Shortcodes to send links and images
* Online users count (fingerprinting detection)
* Admin user (with a secret nickname prefix)
* List online clients IP (By admin command)
* Clear the chat history (By admin command)
* JSON API

#### TODO:

* New admin user features
* New shortcodes features in orden to allow font styles, etc
