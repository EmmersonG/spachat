SPAChat (Simple PHP Ajax Chat)
=======

Version: 1.1
Author: [Jonas Sciangula Street](http://www.joni2back.com/) <joni2back {{ at }} gmail {{.}} com>


#### Requires:
* PHP 5.3
* MySQL 4 | 5


This project is a refactor of [Joni2Back MySQL Ajax Chat](http://sourceforge.net/projects/joni2back-chat/), 
now called "SPAChat - Simple PHP Ajax Chat".

This lite chat app is developed with a simple MVC architecture.

#### Here are some of the features that I think could be useful: 

* Customizable chat history items number
* Shortcodes to send links and images
* Show online users (not only per IP)
* Admin user (with a secret nickname prefix)
* List online clients IP (By admin command)
* Clear the chat history (By admin command)
* jQuery integration
* JSON Responses
    
    
#### Nice to have (@todo):

* Some other features for admin user
* Extend the shortcodes features in orden to allow font styles, etc
* Audio notifications
* Auto remove old chat history items
